# quick-file-actions package

Quickly copy, delete, move, and create new files.

With any file open do:

* ctrl-alt-F + C: copy
* ctrl-alt-F + D: delete
* ctrl-alt-F + M: move
* ctrl-alt-F + N: new

Or through the command palette.

Deleting moves the file to the trash bin by default, there's an option to change
this behaviour.
